              We found a venue with accommodations to prevent extra travelling

              <ul>
                <li>
                  We encourage you to park at Ivey Spencer prior to the wedding
                  ceremony and take a 10 minute walk down Windermere Rd. to the
                  chapel and back.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We are working with the venue to take the compost with us
                  after the celebrations (since London is one of the last major
                  cities that does not yet have a public compost program).

                <li>
                  We chose a buffet style dinner so you can just take the food
                  you will actually eat and hopefully prevent half your plate
                  from being tossed.

                Please consider parking at Ivey Spencer Leadership Centre and
                walking to the Church (about a 5-10 minute walk). There will be
                plenty of time to walk back following Mass and before the
                reception.

              genuinely caring friend. Our friendship started at King’s together
              in CST, where we bonded over Shakespeare, Taylor Swift, and our
              love for tea, and it has grown into an unbreakable bond. I am
              grateful that we have been able to share every life milestone
              together since we met from undergrad and masters graduations to
              engagements, and now both of our marriages. Philip and I are
              excited to grow in our marriage with Danielle and her wonderful
              husband, Nathan, by our sides. I am so grateful that she has been
              an active part of our relationship since our first date and will
              continue to grow with us and adventure together (maybe even in

              Marissa is my steadfast, lifelong chosen sister. We met in first
              year residence at King’s and continued to live together at “The
              Beehive” for 5 more years. Some of my absolute best memories from
              University include (or are because of) Marissa; from late night
              essays and studying, to spontaneous dance parties and attending
              paint nights. She has a contagious laugh, and brings a positive
              attitude into every interaction. If you want a snapshot of our
              friendship, our birthday posts on Facebook are a pretty good
              example &lt;3 Marissa is such a loving person who truly puts her
              family first and never misses an opportunity to express her love
              for her friends in creative ways. I’m so grateful that she has
              been with me through many ups and downs and an especially key
              player in my relationship with Philip since our very first date

              Katie is a free-spirit, a spontaneous, (sometimes) reckless, yet

              conversationalist, and has a truly genuine, beautiful soul. We
              only really became close in 2019, but it was an instant bond for
              life. Through the “Catholic Weasels,” Rick McGhie, spontaneous
              road trips to waterfalls or Port Stanley beach in the winter, and
              deep life chats, we formed a fast friendship only continue to grow
              and mature, no matter how much time passes between seeing each
              other (like Katie moving more than 2700km up North for a year).
              Katie is also the artist behind Philip and my engagement photos
              &lt;3 I am so grateful that she is such a solid friend. I think we
              can add “journey together through both ministry and toward
              marriage” to our “Katie & Molly adventure bucket list” and check
              it off soon.

              Beth is my kindred spirit. We met in September of 2019 on a King’s
              retreat, and started to slowly get to know each other until
              December when our friendship was welded together like steel at
              RiseUp in Toronto (the same conference where I met my future
              husband). Beth is such a kind, thoughtful, introspective,
              intuitive, and patient person. She has genuine care for all her
              friends, family, and chosen sisters, is an incredible
              communicator, and someone I am so excited to journey through life
              with. She has been present in our relationship from before Philip
              and I started dating (and knew both of us separately before we
              even met!) I am so grateful that Beth is a constant in my life and
              that we get to journey toward the Sacrament of Marriage at the
